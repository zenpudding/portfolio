        <p>After I transitioned to contract work with Digital Scientists, I redesigned several pages on the company site. This effort was focused on painting the company as a hub of insight and expertise, rather than just a technology service provider. One of the tasks was to turn their existing blog page into a more partitioned editorial center.  Thus, the page was renamed to Perspectives with a sub navigation to each of the different spheres.</p>

        <p>Implementation-wise, they wanted the least effort in porting over existing content from older blog posts.  The list format of wide image banner and title/subtitle remained, as well as the actual blog post format. As for the splash image for each of the perspectives, I maintained the general aesthetic of illustration applied on the company page, but tried to go for more abstraction and layering for some visual pull.</p>

        <p>Next on the list was the company page. Previously a 'Team' page, this section of the site was dedicated to display aspects of company ideology, culture, members, and community. In the process of establishing a newer look and motif for the site, I repeated thin bounding strokes on most elements. The icon illustrations also set a secondary palette to work with.  I had taken the team photos from the previous iteration of this page, so we simply ported them over.</p><img src="/img/case-ds-company.jpg">
