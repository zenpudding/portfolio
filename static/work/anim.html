        <p>I've been a lifelong fan of animation, from watching countless cartoons as a kid to taking a few classes in college on its history and theory. I got started with motion graphics while interning at Georgia Public Broadcasting, helping to create video assets for television and football stadiums. In making the transition into ux and visual design, animating interactions for apps and such became a valuable skill.</p>
        <p>Below are a few clips I made for the Digital Scientists website.</p>
