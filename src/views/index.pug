      p I'm a Product Designer with front-end savvy. In addition to contributing in the full range of UX and visual sub-disciplines, I'm often knee-deep implementing my own designs or being a bridge between the design and dev camps.
      
      p This kind of do-it-myself attitude has its drawbacks, but it has made me into a sort of design/dev amoeba. In the end, I just enjoy building cool things with cool people. I've just found myself doing all sorts of things along the way.
