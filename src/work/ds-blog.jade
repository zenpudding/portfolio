        p Digital Scientists wanted to turn their existing blog page into a more partitioned editorial center.  Thus, the page was renamed to Perspectives with a sub navigation to each of the different spheres.  Each section would have a feature article and several tags. The goal of this part of the site was to get people interested in the voice of the company and to subscribe to the newsletter.

        p Implementation-wise, they wanted the least effort in porting over existing content from older blog posts.  The list format of wide image banner and title/subtitle remained, as well as the actual blog post format. As for the splash image for each of the perspectives, I maintained the general aesthetic of illustration applied on the company page, but tried to go for more abstraction and layering for some visual pull.
