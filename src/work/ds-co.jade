        p After I transitioned to contract work with Digital Scientists, I redesigned several pages on the company site.  Previously a 'Team' page, this section of the site was dedicated to display aspects of company ideology, culture, members, and community.
        p In the process of establishing a newer look and motif for the site, I repeated thin bounding strokes on most elements. The icon illustrations also set a secondary palette to work with.  I had taken the team photos from the previous iteration of this page, so we simply ported them over.
