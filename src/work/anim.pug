        p I've been a lifelong fan of animation, from watching countless cartoons as a kid to taking a few classes in college on its history and theory. I got started with motion graphics while interning at Georgia Public Broadcasting, helping create video assets for television and football stadiums. The ability to convey ideas beyond plain static imagery helped inform and bolster my UX work, helping me gauge what transitions made sense.

        p I also practice 2D animation as a hobby. In 2015, I made a mock opening animation for a game called Dota 2, where I rendered game characters in an anime style. The video was a minute and a half in length, but took over a thousand drawings.
