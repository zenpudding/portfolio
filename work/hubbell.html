        <p>Hubbell Power Systems came to us to add a feature to their parts catalog app - an adaptation of a paper configurator wheel that electricians use to replace components on utility poles.</p><img src="/img/case-hubbell-wheel.jpg">
        <p>We had to ensure that there wasn't a huge learning curve to go from the analog selectors to the one in the app. Keeping the general flow of steps the same was important in maintaining familiarity.</p>

      <div class="case-body">
        <p>We kept the analog action of the wheel and reinvented it into a horizontal ticker bar. The results produced from each configuration would link to the existing SKU pages of the greater app. To further smoothen the transition, we included a tutorial that would load on first use.</p><img src="/img/case-hubbell-screen.jpg">
