        <p>I've been a film enthusiast since college, where I had a few classes on history and production. Plenty of practice followed with club activity recordings, fraternity recruitment videos, and participation in Campus Movie Fest. While working as a UX/Visual Designer, I had the opportunity to use some of these skills creating video assets for sites and apps.</p>
        <p>An example is the usage of video backgrounds for a header carousel on a page for the Digital Scientists website. Since we were providing a service called "Contextual Solution", ambient video served as the "context" for taglines and apps.</p>

      <video class="wide" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" poster="/img/case-video-1-static.jpg" src="/img/case-video-1.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="auto"></video>

        <p>At Digital Scientists, we periodically worked on our in-house app, an online shopping tool called Rately. Many times, it was hard to describe the app to others, in which case pointing to a video helped greatly convey its functionalities short of them actually using the app. We used live footage for tutorials that we posted on the Rately blog, and used screen-only footage for the landing site.</p>

        <p>Filming a narrative is a different beast than just recording raw footage. Editing to form a cohesive story, as well as finding creative ways to emulate expensive film equipment was a humbling experience for every project. Below are a few examples of works I've made.</p>
